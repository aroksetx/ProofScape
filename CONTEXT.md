# Technical Specification: Golang Web Page Screenshot Analysis Tool

## Project Overview

Create a robust Go application that automatically captures and analyzes screenshots of web pages after deployment. The tool will accept URLs via configuration and generate two types of screenshots for each page:

1. Full-page screenshots capturing the entire page content
2. Viewport-limited screenshots divided into sections based on the browser's visible area

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality

- Process multiple URLs from a configuration file
- Generate full-page screenshots for each URL
- Generate viewport-specific screenshots for each URL
- Support concurrent processing of multiple URLs
- Support customizable viewport dimensions
- Support configurable delay times for page loading
- Organize screenshots with consistent naming and directory structure

### Technology Stack

- **Language**: Go 1.18+
- **Browser Automation**: ChromeDP package for controlling Chrome/Chromium
- **Configuration**: JSON-based configuration
- **Concurrency**: Utilize Go's native goroutines and channels

## Project Structure

```
screenshot-tool/
├── config/
│   └── config.go       # Configuration handling
├── screenshot/
│   ├── screenshoter.go # Screenshot capture logic
│   └── utils.go        # Utility functions
├── main.go             # Entry point
├── go.mod              # Go module definition
├── go.sum              # Dependency checksums
├── config.json         # Default configuration
└── README.md           # Documentation
```

## Configuration Format

The tool should accept a JSON configuration file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "urls": [
    {
      "name": "example-homepage",
      "url": "https://example.com",
      "viewport": {
        "width": 1920,
        "height": 1080
      },
      "delay": 1000
    }
  ],
  "defaultViewport": {
    "width": 1280,
    "height": 800
  },
  "outputDir": "./screenshots",
  "fileFormat": "png",
  "quality": 80,
  "concurrency": 2
}
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Configuration Handling

- Create a package to load and validate the configuration file
- Implement proper error handling for missing or malformed configuration
- Set reasonable defaults for optional parameters
- Ensure output directories exist or create them

### 2. Screenshot Capture

- Use ChromeDP to control Chrome/Chromium browser
- Implement screenshot capturing with proper cleanup
- Handle errors gracefully for failed page loads
- Support both full-page and viewport-limited screenshots
- Implement proper timeout handling

### 3. Concurrency

- Implement a worker pool pattern using goroutines
- Use semaphores or worker pools to limit concurrency
- Ensure proper synchronization for filesystem operations
- Handle graceful shutdown on interruption

### 4. File Management

- Implement consistent naming for screenshots with timestamps
- Create proper directory structure for organized storage
- Handle filesystem errors appropriately

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the application
2. **Logging**: Use Go's standard logging package or a dedicated logging library
3. **Testing**: Write unit tests for core functionality
4. **Documentation**: Add proper documentation and comments to the code
5. **Extensibility**: Design the system to be easily extendable for future features

## Deliverables

1. Complete Go application source code
2. Documentation on usage and configuration
3. Sample configuration file
4. Build and run instructions

## Optional Extensions

1. API server for triggering screenshot captures via HTTP
2. Visual comparison with previous screenshots for regression testing
3. HTML report generation with screenshot previews
4. Integration with CI/CD systems via webhooks
